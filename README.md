# 4th-Year-Thesis
This is my Final year undergraduate thesis on "Current retrieval for remote sensing images of ocean waves". Thus far I have completed explanatory analysis of the first set of ocean wave radar images. This involved plotting the current profile, modelling the time evolution of the free surface of the ocean waves and converting the free surface evolution into the spectral (frequency) domain using a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Then, I created a function that slices the dispersion surface for different frequency values. Using this I was able to analyse the energy spectrum in the $k_{x}$ and $k_{y}$ space, finding the maximum energy for specific values of $k_{x}$ and $k_{y}$. Thus, I had triplet points from the wave data that model the dispersion relation of the current induced waves. 

Currently, I have been trying to implement three different minimization algorithms - the least squares method, the normalized product method and the power currrent shell method which all attempt to use the previously calculated triplets to find the ocean current at various "k" vector values. I have been looking into how input data leads to errors and how the effect of noise on the data can be reduced.
